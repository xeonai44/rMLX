///
/// | cell | on vs off | token digest |

/// | Bonsai-8B k8v4 @~1.7k (`RMLX_TURBO_FLASH_MIN=0`) | 1.93× slower | — |

/// | Bonsai-27B k8v4 @16k | 1.98× slower | identical |
///
/// The loss scales with `kv_seq` rather than being a fixed per-request
/// penalty. Dispatch was proven by counter, not inferred: 1638 kernel
/// dispatches in the ON arm against 0 in the OFF arm. The ON arm also holds
/// 722 468 864 B more resident KV at 16k — the persistent head-major flash
/// buffers sit *on top of* the bf16 mirror and the packed store rather than
/// replacing either. Tightening the ring 4× recovers part of the gap but not
/// the bulk, so it is not a `--max-ctx` sizing artefact.
///
/// **The output is not identical, and that is the codec, not the kernel.**
/// Turning the gate off does not turn the codec off: on `K8V4` the generic
/// decode path reads the bf16 mirror and never touches the 4-bit V store
/// (`KvQuant::decode_reads_packed_store` is `false` for it), so the OFF arm is
/// a bf16 attention and **any** correct tq4-V kernel must differ from it by the
/// codec's own quantization error. Measuring the kernel against that arm
/// charges it for the codec.
///
/// Measured against a reference that *does* run the codec —
/// `turbo_flash_reference_sdpa`, a dequantize-then-SDPA over the identical
/// `flash_*` buffers at the kernel's own f32 working precision — the kernel is
/// gated at **cosine ≥ 0.999999 and ≤ 0.5 bf16 ULP per row** and measures 0.056
/// ULP at worst, two of three cells bit-identical. The cells are the two
/// dispatching geometries plus an additive-mask cell, on a ring whose stride is
/// wider than its fill and whose last block is partial — i.e. decode as
/// production drives it, at `q_seq = 1`. The kernel is
/// therefore accurate *for its codec*; the ≈0.997 SDPA cosine against bf16 is
/// the tq4-V codec floor, and at temp=0 that floor flips greedy argmax ties
/// prompt-dependently. So this is a decode loss plus a codec-fidelity cost —
/// not a kernel defect.
///
/// `gemma-4-e2b` (`kv_h=1`, `head_dim=256`, SWA 512) is a **null control**,
/// not a second architecture: at 4k its `kv_cache_bytes` is bit-identical
