NO PRESET BELOW REDUCES MEMORY BELOW fp16 — fp16 is the unquantised reference,
and every other name resolves to a codec whose decode reads the bf16 mirror, so
its packed store is never built: the served request holds the same resident KV
as fp16 and emits the same tokens. Pinned by `no_preset_is_a_memory_lever`,
which sweeps the preset table and fails the build the day one of these targets
starts building a store. Decode throughput against fp16 is INCONCLUSIVE, so
they are not known to cost anything either. They are kept because the names
appear in recorded bench rows and each is its codec's entry point, not because
one of them is a smaller cache.

  INERT — every preset target except fp16:
      speed resolves to tsym3, quality to tsym4, planar to planar, planar3 to
      planar3, k_only_planar to planar_k. q8 resolves to k8v8, which is inert
      too. Decode reads the bf16 mirror on both axes for all six, so the packed
      store is never built and the codec math never runs.

Special value:
  auto      -- the same codec `--kv-quant auto` resolves to (unquantised bf16).
               It does not inspect the hardware: the memory-pressure selector
               that used to live here returned a preset that saves no bytes.

Presets:
  fp16          -- bf16 both sides (unquantised; KvQuant::None)
  q8            -- symmetric 8-bit K+V (KvQuant::K8V8)
  speed         -- TurboSym3 (symmetric 3-bit Lloyd-Max K+V; rejected on Qwen MoE)
  quality       -- TurboSym4 (symmetric 4-bit Lloyd-Max K+V; rejected on Qwen MoE — see arch guard note*)

  bf16 (alias none; what auto resolves to)
      Unquantised bf16 K and V. The reference the listing's ratios are
      against.

  INERT — accepted, but does nothing:
      k8v4, k8v8, planar, planar3, planar_k, k8vturbo2, k8vturbo2tcq,
      k8vturbo3, k8vturbo3tcq, tsym3, tsym4, iso3, iso4, rotor3, rotor4,
      rotor_k_3_asym_v<vb>_g<vg>, rotor_k_4_asym_v<vb>_g<vg>.
      Decode reads the bf16 mirror on both axes, so the packed store is never
      built and the codec math never runs. Resident KV and generated tokens
      measure identical to bf16, on two architectures at two contexts; decode
      throughput against it is INCONCLUSIVE, so selecting one is not known to
      cost anything either. It simply does not do what the name says.

  Runs its codec, decoding over its own packed store:
      mixed_k<kb>g<kg>_v<vb>g<vg>, rot_k_v<vb>g<vg>, iso3_sym, iso4_sym,
      k_iso3, k_iso4, rotor3_sym, rotor4_sym, k_rotor3, k_rotor4.
      Two mechanisms decide what that costs, and they pull opposite ways:
      * mixed_* / rot_k_* keep a bf16 K/V mirror beside their store only where
        the model's layers share K/V, because that mirror is what the consumer
        layers read. There they hold the store AND two full bf16 buffers;
        everywhere else the mirror is not built and the store is the whole cost.
        One codec, two answers — the listing prints both.
      * The iso and rotor families keep no mirror on any architecture. Their
        rate is the ring's, which is fixed by head_dim and by the sideband
        width — not by the bit width in the name, which is a codebook. The two
        members of a family are byte-identical for that reason.
      Whether either is *below* bf16 is the listing's business, not this text's.

WHAT THIS FLAG SHRINKS DEPENDS ON THE MODEL. Every value except (8, 128)
resolves to the mixed_* codec, whose bf16 K/V mirror is retained on exactly one
kind of architecture: one whose layers share K/V across layers (Gemma4), where
that mirror is what the consumer layers read. There the cache holds the packed
store AND both mirrors and is LARGER than plain bf16. Where the layers do not
share K/V, the mirror is not built and the packed store is the whole cache.
`rmlx info --list-cache-types` computes both figures per codec; this flag names
no ratio because the answer is not one number. The single exception below is
neither smaller nor larger:

  INERT — accepted, but does nothing:
      k8v8, which is what (8, 128) resolves to.
      Decode reads the bf16 mirror on both axes, so its packed store is never
      built: resident KV and generated tokens measure identical to bf16.

`--kv-bits` cannot reach a codec smaller than bf16 on a shared-KV architecture:
every value it maps to is in the mirrored family. The codecs that compress there
are reached through `--kv-quant`; `rmlx info --list-cache-types` names which.

Integer mapping:
  --kv-bits 8 --kv-group-size 128  → k8v8 (see INERT above)
  --kv-bits 4 --kv-group-size 64   → mixed_k8g64_v4g64  [mlx-lm default]
  --kv-bits 4 --kv-group-size 32   → mixed_k8g64_v4g32
  --kv-bits 3 --kv-group-size 64   → mixed_k8g64_v3g64
  other (bits, group_size)         → mixed_k8g64_v<bits>g<group_size>

Fractional mapping (MLX affine, K=floor / V=ceil — not TurboQuant):
  --kv-bits 3.5 --kv-group-size 64 → mixed_k3g64_v4g64
  --kv-bits 4.5 --kv-group-size 64 → mixed_k4g64_v5g64
  Fractional bits: K=floor(bits), V=ceil(bits), both sides use group_size.

K always defaults to 8-bit / group=64 for integer values (mlx-lm K=8 convention).
When --kv-group-size is omitted, group_size defaults to 64.
Valid bits: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 for integers, 3..8 for the floor and ceil of a
fraction. Valid group sizes: 32, 64, 128 — the set the MLX affine
quantizer implements. Anything else is a parse error, not a mode.";

/// Long-help for `--kv-boundary-layers`, shared by every subcommand that takes it.
const KV_BOUNDARY_LAYERS_LONG_HELP: &str = "\
How many leading and trailing decoder layers are held at the boundary floor,
as `<head>,<tail>`. Default `2,8`.

A boundary layer runs the quality floor instead of the requested codec. For a
codec whose widths are parameters (`mixed_*`, `rot_k_*`) the floor is that
codec's own 8-bit form. For every other quantizing codec the floor is a target
that materialises no packed store and decodes at model dtype, so those boundary
layers are bf16 layers and cost bf16 bytes.

The counts are therefore a memory knob as well as a quality one, and the
default is inherited rather than derived: raising `head` or `tail` spends more
bytes at the floor, and `0,0` turns the promotion off entirely and runs the
requested codec on every layer.

How many layers this actually moves is a property of the model, not the flag.
A windowed (sliding-attention) layer runs the bf16 rotating ring whatever it is
handed, and a shared-KV consumer layer owns no cache at all, so on an
architecture whose head and tail are all windowed or all consumers the flag
changes nothing. `rmlx info --list-cache-types` reports the per-layer mix.

Runs at a non-default value are recorded in `decode_config` as
`kv_boundary/head=<h>,kv_boundary/tail=<t>`, so they rank as their own cell and
never against a default-boundary run.";
